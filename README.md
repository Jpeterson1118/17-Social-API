  ## Installation

  Install all dependencies with npm install and build and run the server using npm start.

  ## Usage
  Once the server is built and started a user can use insomnia to make HTTP requests. The server accepts post, get, put and delete requests for users. Once one or more users is added, the user may get all users, or get/put/delete a user by ID. They may also add or delete a friend using user IDs, and add, edit, view, and delete thoughts and reactions in a similar manner.

  Please refer to the walkthrough video linked below or the files located in src/routes for API routes. The application currently does not feature any GUI or client.
